## Interesting Findings
Discussion of the most interesting findings from user testing:

#### Finding 1: Task Difficulty Perception

Users had varied experiences with the tasks, indicating different levels of difficulty. Some found all tasks easy, while others pointed out specific tasks as challenging. For example, Task 6 (figuring out who has settled their debt) was noted as the hardest by some users due to navigation complexities.

#### Finding 2: Accessibility and Visual Design
There were concerns regarding the visibility and accessibility of certain UI elements. Users with limited vision found the group highlights and text sizes difficult to see, suggesting a need for better contrast and possibly larger or adjustable text sizes.

During our usability testing, several key insights stood out, providing valuable feedback for improving our app. Here are the most interesting findings:
- #### Assumed User Knowledge:
    Despite our efforts to make the app intuitive, it became apparent that some steps were still confusing for users who were unfamiliar with the app. This highlighted the need to address our inherent bias as creators who are overly familiar with the appâ€™s functionalities.

- #### Visual Clarity and Accessibility:
    Users with limited vision struggled with certain visual elements, such as the group highlight colour and small text sizes. This feedback emphasised the importance of enhancing visual accessibility to ensure all users can navigate the app comfortably.

- #### Navigation and User Flow:
    The lack of a "back" button and the nesting of information under multiple taps were noted as potential frustrations. This pointed to a need for more intuitive navigation options, ensuring that users can easily correct mistakes and access frequently used features quickly.

- #### Consistency and Feedback:
    Inconsistencies in confirmation dialogues and the absence of notifications for unresolved expenses were highlighted. Implementing consistent feedback mechanisms and notifications would improve the user experience by making it more cohesive and informative.

- #### Onboarding and Tutorials:
    Participants suggested a prompt-based tutorial during the initial launch to help new users understand the app's layout and features better. This indicates that guided onboarding could significantly improve the ease of initial use.

- #### High Satisfaction Scores:
    Our SEQ and SUS scores were significantly higher than our goals and industry standards, reflecting strong overall user satisfaction. This suggests that, while there are areas for improvement, the general user experience with the app is very positive.
    
These findings are crucial as they provide a clear direction for refining our app to better meet user needs and enhance overall usability. Addressing these issues will help create a more accessible, intuitive, and satisfying experience for all users.

## Learning Summary
Summary of what was learned from user testing:

#### Lesson 1: Importance of Clear Instructions and Navigation

The testing highlighted the necessity for clear and intuitive navigation. Users need guidance, especially for complex tasks. Implementing tutorials or tooltips could help users understand the app's functionality better.

#### Lesson 2: Need for Enhanced Accessibility Features

The feedback pointed out the importance of making the app accessible to users with different needs. Enhancing visual contrast, increasing text sizes, and ensuring key functions are easily accessible can make the app more user-friendly.

#### Lesson 3: First-time user experience is critical.

Several comments indicated that the app was easy to learn and use once you got oriented, but more could be done to make core tasks immediately obvious for new users.

## Significant Results
Discussion of the most significant results:

#### Result 1: Variability in Task Completion

Task completion was generally high, with most tasks rated as 5-7 out of 7 for ease. This suggests the core functionality is in a good place. However, the lower ratings and struggles noted, especially on Tasks 4-6, indicate specific workflow improvements are still needed.

#### Result 2: Positive Feedback on Core Features

Despite some difficulties, the core functionalities such as creating a group, adding expenses, and resolving expenses were generally well-received. Users found these tasks intuitive once they navigated through the app, suggesting that the app's primary features are effective but could benefit from enhanced guidance and accessibility improvements.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the user testing validated that the app is headed in the right direction but needs some UX optimizations before launch. Key priorities should be: 1) Smoothing out the onboarding experience and core user journeys with clearer signposting, 2) Reviewing the information architecture to make key details easy to find, and 3) Auditing and aligning the UI with accessibility best practices and modern design conventions. With some targeted enhancements in these areas, I believe the app could be both powerful and user-friendly.
