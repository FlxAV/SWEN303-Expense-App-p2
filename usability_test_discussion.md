## Interesting Findings
Discussion of the most interesting findings from user testing:

#### Finding 1: Task Difficulty Perception

Users had varied experiences with the tasks, indicating different levels of difficulty. Some found all tasks easy, while others pointed out specific tasks as challenging. For example, Task 6 (figuring out who has settled their debt) was noted as the hardest by some users due to navigation complexities.

#### Finding 2: Accessibility and Visual Design
There were concerns regarding the visibility and accessibility of certain UI elements. Users with limited vision found the group highlights and text sizes difficult to see, suggesting a need for better contrast and possibly larger or adjustable text sizes.

## Learning Summary
Summary of what was learned from user testing:

#### Lesson 1: Importance of Clear Instructions and Navigation

The testing highlighted the necessity for clear and intuitive navigation. Users need guidance, especially for complex tasks. Implementing tutorials or tooltips could help users understand the app's functionality better.

#### Lesson 2: Need for Enhanced Accessibility Features

The feedback pointed out the importance of making the app accessible to users with different needs. Enhancing visual contrast, increasing text sizes, and ensuring key functions are easily accessible can make the app more user-friendly.

#### Lesson 3: First-time user experience is critical.

Several comments indicated that the app was easy to learn and use once you got oriented, but more could be done to make core tasks immediately obvious for new users.

## Significant Results
Discussion of the most significant results:

#### Result 1: Variability in Task Completion

Task completion was generally high, with most tasks rated as 5-7 out of 7 for ease. This suggests the core functionality is in a good place. However, the lower ratings and struggles noted, especially on Tasks 4-6, indicate specific workflow improvements are still needed.

#### Result 2: Positive Feedback on Core Features

Despite some difficulties, the core functionalities such as creating a group, adding expenses, and resolving expenses were generally well-received. Users found these tasks intuitive once they navigated through the app, suggesting that the app's primary features are effective but could benefit from enhanced guidance and accessibility improvements.
