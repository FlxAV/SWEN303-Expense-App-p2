### Introduction

The purpose of our app is to help flat groups effectively track and manage their expenses.

To use the app, sign in or create an account. Once signed in, you can create a group in the Manage tab to share with other flat members. You can add, view, and manage expenses within your group. Members can be added or removed anytime. Expenses can be added through the Add tab, assigned to groups and members, and split three ways: Numeric, Percent, and Even. The Activity tab shows all expenses, and expenses can be marked as resolved. The Profile tab lets you personalise your account and change settings like your profile picture, email, or app appearance.

We appreciate your honest feedback. Your responses are completely anonymous, and no personal information will be recorded or displayed. Thank you for taking the time to review our product

### Your Tasks

During the testing process, you will complete six tasks within our Figma app. Three tasks will come with step-by-step instructions, while the other three are to be completed without guidance. This approach helps us understand both how you learn the app and how you navigate it independently. Don’t hesitate to make any comments if there are significant differences between the two methods. After each task, you will answer a single question about your experience. Once all tasks are complete, there will be a final questionnaire about your overall experience with the six tasks.  We have chosen to handle our questionnaires in this way so that we will have data to analyse for both the individual tasks and the overall experience with all tasks as a whole. Additionally, there will be a few specific questions and an optional section for any further comments and feedback.

As mentioned, for the first three tasks we will take you step by step until you have completed the task, feel free to voice any concerns or opinions while completing the task.
